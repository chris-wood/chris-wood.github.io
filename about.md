Ph.D. student in computer science, aspiring scientist and applied cryptographer, triathlete and quasi-crossfitter, late-night software engineer, and nu-metal lover.

### The Daily Grind

I am currently a core developer of CCNx in the Computer Science Laboratory at PARC (Palo Alto Research Center). My research focuses on the intersection of security and privacy, applied cryptography, theory and formal methods, and content centric networking. Lately, I have been working on encryption-based access control and trust management in CCN.
