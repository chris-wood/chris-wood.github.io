    abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a candidate next-generation Internet architecture
that offers an alternative to the current IP-based model. CCN emphasizes scalable and
efficient content distribution by making content explicitly named and addressable.
It also offers some appealing privacy features, such as lack of source and
destination addresses in packets. However, to be considered a fully viable Internet
architecture, CCN must support private and anonymous communication that is
at least at parity with IP. Within this space, VPNs are a very
popular tool that enable users to communicate across insecure public
networks as if they were connected over a private network.
They are also absent from the repertoire of CCN research.
To fill this void, we design, implement, and evaluate CCVPN, a content-centric
analog to IP-based VPNs in the current Internet architecture.
To the best of our knowledge, CCVPN is the first such CCN-based design.
Our design is functionally equivalent to IP-based VPNs while gaining
better privacy due to the non-linkability of encapsulated packets to their originating
network. We analyze the security of CCVPN and experimentally assess its performance."

        code: https://github.com/chris-wood/ccn-onpath-simulation-ccnsim
    abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a recently proposed Internet paradigm that focuses
on scalable, secure and efficient content distribution. The main abstraction is named
and addressable content. A consumer requests desired named content by generating
a so-called {\em interest}, which is then routed by the network towards
an in-network cached copy, or the authoritative producer, of that content.
Since all CCN content must be signed by its producer, consumers and routers
can cryptographically verify its correctness, authenticity, and integrity.
Thus, in principle, attacks that introduce fake (poisoned) content can be detected.
However, verifying content signatures is optional for CCN routers,
detection of fake content only implies presence of a malicious upstream entity.
A major outstanding problem in CCN is how to react to such attacks, determine their source(s),
and re-route interests accordingly.

In this work, we construct a technique based on efficient per-hop packet integrity checks.
Routers share secrets with neighboring routers and use them to verify and generate
efficient per-hop packet authenticators.
An on-path attacker that tampers with content in transit is quickly detected by downstream
routers. Moreover, an on-path attacker that hijacks a namespace is discoverable.
Our experimental assessment indicates that the proposed technique incurs very
low per-packet overhead. Furthermore, since our approach is not CCN-specific,
it can be applied to IP-based networks as well."

    abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a network architecture for transferring
named content from producers to consumers upon request. The name-to-content
binding is cryptographically enforced with a digital signature generated by
the producer. Thus, content integrity and origin authenticity are core features of CCN.
In contrast, content confidentiality and privacy are left to the applications.
The typically advocated approach for protecting sensitive content is to use encryption,
i.e., restrict access to those who have appropriate decryption key(s). Moreover, content is typically
encrypted once for identical requests, meaning that many consumers obtain the same
encrypted content. From a privacy perspective, this is a step backwards from the
``secure channel'' approach in today's IP-based Internet, e.g., TLS or IPSec.

In this paper, we assess the privacy pitfalls of this approach, particularly, when the
adversary learns some auxiliary information about popularity of certain plaintext content.
Merely by observing (or learning) the frequency of requested content, the adversary can
learn which encrypted corresponds to which plaintext data. We evaluate this attack using a
custom CCN simulator and show that even moderately accurate popularity information suffices
for accurate mapping. We also show how the adversary can exploit caches to learn content popularity
information. The adversary needs to know the content namespace in order to succeed.
Our results show that encryption-based access control is insufficient for privacy in CCN.
More extensive counter-measures (such as namespace restrictions and content replication)
are needed to mitigate the attack."

    abstract: "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a recent paradigm that claims
to mitigate some limitations of the current IP-based Internet
architecture. The centerpiece of ICN is named and addressable content,
rather than hosts or interfaces. Content-Centric Networking (CCN)
is a prominent ICN instance that shares the fundamental architectural
design with its equally popular academic sibling Named-Data
Networking (NDN). CCN eschews source addresses and creates
one-time virtual circuits for every content request (called an
interest). As an interest is forwarded it creates state in
intervening routers and the requested content is delivered back
over the reverse path using that state.

Although a stateful forwarding plane might be beneficial in terms
of efficiency and resilience to certain types of attacks,
this has not been decisively proven via realistic experiments.
Since keeping per-interest state complicates router operations
and makes the infrastructure susceptible to router state
exhaustion attacks (e.g., there is currently no effective defense
against Interest Flooding attacks), the value of the
stateful forwarding plane in CCN should be re-examined.

In this paper, we explore supposed benefits and various problems
of the stateful forwarding plane. We then argue that its benefits are
uncertain at best, and it need not be a mandatory CCN feature.
To this end, we propose a new stateless architecture for CCN
that provides nearly all functionality of the stateful design
without its headaches. We analyze performance and resource
requirements of the proposed architecture via experiments."

        code: https://github.com/chris-wood/tsec-performance
    abstract: "In the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) architecture, content confidentiality is treated
as an application-layer concern. Data is only encrypted if the producer and consumer
agree on a suitable access control policy and enforcement mechanism. In contrast,
transport encryption in TCP/IP applications is increasingly opportunistic for
better privacy. This type of encryption is woefully lacking in CCN.
To that end, we present TRAPS, a protocol to enable transparent packet security
and opportunistic encryption for all CCN data. TRAPS builds on the assumption that
knowledge of a name gives one access to the corresponding content; otherwise, by design, the
content remains encrypted and secure. TRAPS builds on recent advances in memory
hard functions and message-locked encryption to protect data in transit.
We show that the security of TRAPS is dependent on the distribution of content
names and argue that it can be significantly improved if secure sessions are
used to transmit small pieces of information from producers to consumers. Our
performance assessment indicates TRAPS is capable of providing opportunistic
encryption to CCN without significant throughput loss for reasonable packet
throughput measurements."

    abstract: "Content-centric networking (CCN) is a network architecture for transferring named data from producers to
consumers upon request. This shifts security from that of a connection or channel
to the content itself. There remains, however, many critical uses for the traditional client-server
communication model with secure sessions. For instance,
in many CCN applications, producers need a way to transfer key material or secret
information to consumers. Not only does caching this content fail to
serve multiple consumers, encrypting it under long-term, static keys
does not afford them any forward secrecy. Consequently, there is a real and
present need for a CCN-friendly protocol whose security properties
meet or exceed similar transport security protocols in IP networks. In this paper, we present the design
and implementation of the CCNx Key Exchange Protocol -- CCNxKE -- the first
protocol design for bootstrapping encrypted service-centric sessions in CCN.
We compare our design to that of
existing IP-based transport security protocols to highlight important
differences, discuss several important use cases for CCNxKE and secure sessions
in CCN, and present a preliminary performance assessment. Our experiments indicate that
session encryption adds, on average, a 30% data transfer latency compared to unencrypted
traffic using our prototype implementation."

The goal of SCR is to allow a data producer to cache protected content in off-path
semi-trusted caches or replicas. In contrast to the standard ``take what you want'' model of CCN,
SCR ensures that no unauthorized, off-path entity can obtain data from these replicas,
even if the content is encrypted. SCR allows a producer to encrypt data under any viable
access control scheme, such as group-based access backed by broadcast encryption, and delegate
the delivery of said content to distributed replicas in the network. SCR is analogous to
``blind caching'' in IP-based networks, which aim to provide caching
as a service in the presence of end-to-end encryption via TLS. We discuss the design details
and security features, e.g., revocation, of SCR. We then compare SCR to
the HTTP(S)-based blind caching model. We show that our scheme can outperform
blind caching due to (1) less protocol complexity and message overhead, (2) faster session
establishment, and (3) the ability to obtain data in parallel from multiple, independent replicas."

    abstract: "Content-centric networking is an architecture designed to transfer
named and addressable data from producers to consumers. Data retrieval is driven
by a simple request and response protocol. A consumer issues a request for
named data that is routed by the network towards the nearest location where
this data is stored. Once found, the corresponding data is returned to the
consumer. This data-centric model is different from the datagram- and
stream-based protocols used to transport data between endpoints in IP
networks: Instead of being tied to the channel through which data flows,
security and privacy properties apply to data itself.
Consequently, privacy issues in CCN warrant
careful evaluation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive assessment of CCN
privacy issues in the presence of various adversaries.
We specify conditions sufficient to achieve different levels of privacy.
We also show that data privacy is more dependent on requests than
responses for data. We conclude that strong privacy necessitates
some form of session- or channel-based communication, which strongly contradicts
the data-centric nature of CCN. We also discuss how to implement proposed CCN
privacy mechanisms in practice."

emphasizes request-response-based data transfer. A {\em consumer}
issues a request explicitly referencing desired data by name. A {\em producer}
assigns a name to each data it publishes. Names are used both to identify data
to and route traffic between consumers and producers. The type, format, and representation
of names are fundamental to CCN. Currently, names are represented as human-readable
application-layer URIs. This has several important security and performance implications
for the network.

In this paper, we propose to transparently decouple application-layer names from
their network-layer counterparts. We demonstrate a mapping between the two
namespaces that can be deterministically computed by consumers and producers,
using application names formatted according to the standard CCN URI scheme. Meanwhile,
consumers and producers can continue to use application-layer names. We detail the
computation and mapping function requirements and discuss their
impact on consumers, producers, and routers. Finally, we
comprehensively analyze several mapping functions to show their
functional equivalence to standard application names and argue that
they address several issues that stem from propagating application names into
the network."

One major drawback of in-network caching is that content producers have no

producer wishes to delete its content. In this paper, we show how to address
this problem with a protocol called BEAD (Best-Effort Autonomous Deletion).
It performs content deletion via small and secure packets that resemble

We discuss several methods of routing BEAD packets from producers to caching
routers with varying levels of network overhead and efficacy. We assess

Consequently, there have been considerable research and engineering efforts to obtain compact circuit implementations of S-boxes for hardware systems. Building on past work, we present a comprehensive methodology for (1) constructing cryptographically strong affine-power S-boxes over Galois fields and (2) minimizing the VLSI technology-independent combinational logic requirements for their circuit implementations. Motivated by the potential need for larger S-boxes with improved cryptographic properties, we use this methodology to construct area minimized circuits for novel 16-bit S-boxes."

designed to overcome limitations of the current IP-based Internet.
One of the fundamental tenets of CCN is that content is
named and addressable. Consumers request content
by issuing interests with the desired content name. These interests
are forwarded by routers to producers, and the requested content is returned
and optionally cached at each router along the path.

In-network caching makes it difficult to enforce access control policies on sensitive content
since routers only use interest information for forwarding decisions. This motives our work
on Interest-Based Access Control (IBAC) -- a scheme for access control enforcement
using only information contained in interest messages. IBAC makes sensitive content names unpredictable
to unauthorized parties. It supports both hash- and encryption-based
name obfuscation. Interest replay
attacks are addressed by formulating a mutual trust framework between producers and consumers
that enables routers to perform authorization checks before satisfying interests
from local caches. We assess computational, storage, and bandwidth costs
of each IBAC variant. Proposed design is flexible
and allows producers to arbitrarily specify and enforce any type of content access control,
without having to deal with content encryption and
key distribution. This is the first comprehensive CCN access control design
that only uses information contained in interest messages."

    abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a communication paradigm that emphasizes content distribution. Named-Data Networking (NDN) is an instantiation of CCN, a candidate Future Internet Architecture. NDN supports human-readable content naming and router-based content caching which lends itself to efficient, secure, and scalable content distribution. Because of NDN's fundamental requirement that each content object must be signed by its producer, fragmentation has been considered incompatible with NDN since it precludes authentication of individual content fragments by routers. The alternative is to perform hop-by-hop reassembly, which incurs prohibitive delays. In this paper, we show that secure and efficient content fragmentation is both possible and even advantageous in NDN and similar content-centric network architectures that involve signed content. We design a concrete technique that facilitates efficient and secure content fragmentation in NDN, discuss its security guarantees and assess performance. We also describe a prototype implementation and compare performance of cut-through with hop-by-hop fragmentation and reassembly."

    abstract: "This paper proposes a comprehensive encryption-based access control framework for content centric networking (CCN), called \emph{CCN-AC}. This framework is both flexible and extensible, enabling the specification, implementation, and enforcement of a variety of access control policies for sensitive content in the network. The design of CCN-AC heavily relies on the concept of secure content object manifests and leverages them to decouple encrypted content from access policy and specifications for minimum communication overhead and maximum utilization of in-network caches. To demonstrate the flexibility of framework, we also describe how to implement two sample access control schemes, group-based access control and broadcast access control, within CCN-AC framework."

    abstract: "The performance of a pipelined architecture is often limited by incorrectly designed or poorly implemented control logic. Once a design is implemented and meets timing constraints, the mission is to evaluate if it is achieving optimum performance. At this stage, the number of pipelines and functional units are fixed and the amount of resources and memory bandwidth are finalized. If a design is performing suboptimally the only recourse is to improve the control logic. In this paper we present a metric to quantify the achievable performance of a design and use it to analyze performance degradation due to control logic. We analyze the control logic of existing architectures and present improvements that achieve speedups of up to 10.7x."

    abstract: "Content-centric networking (CCN) project, a flavor of information-centric networking (ICN), decouples data from its source by shifting the emphasis from hosts and interfaces to information. As a result, content becomes directly accessible and routable within the network. In this data-centric paradigm, techniques for maintaining content confidentiality and privacy typically rely on cryptographic techniques similar to those used in modern digital rights management (DRM) applications, which often require multiple consumer-to-producer (end-to-end) messages to be transmitted to establish identities, acquire licenses, and access encrypted content. In this paper, we present a secure content distribution architecture for CCN that is based on proxy re-encryption. Our design provides strong end-to-end content security and reduces the number of protocol messages required for user authentication and key retrieval. Unlike widely-deployed solutions, our solution is also capable of utilizing the opportunistic in-network caches in CCN. We also experimentally compare two proxy re-encryption schemes that can be used to implement the architecture, and describe the proof of concept application we developed over CCNx."

    abstract: "One of the pitfalls of FPGA design is the relatively long implementation time when compared to alternative architec- tures, such as CPU, GPU or DSP. This time can be greatly reduced however by using tools that can generate hardware systems in the form of a hardware description language (HDL) from high- level languages such as C, C++, or Python. Such implementations can be optimized by applying special directives that focus the high-level synthesis (HLS) effort on particular objectives, such as performance, area, throughput, or power consumption. In this paper we examine the benefits of this approach by comparing the performance and design times of HLS generated systems versus custom systems for matrix multiplication. We investigate matrix multiplication using a standard algorithm, Strassen algorithm, and a sparse algorithm to provide a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities and usability of the Xilinx Vivado HLS tool. In our experience, a hardware-oriented electrical engineering student can achieve up to 61% of the performance of custom designs with 1/3 the effort, thus enabling faster hardware acceleration of many compute-bound algorithms."

    abstract: "Chaos theory is the study of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions and exhibit seemingly random behavior. From the perspective of cryp- tography and information security, randomness generated from entirely deterministic systems is a very appealing property. As such, the application of chaos in modern cryptography has been a topic of much research and debate for over a decade.
This paper presents an overview of chaotic dynamics and their role in symmetric key chaos-based cryptosystems from both a theoretical and practical perspective. It is argued that chaos-based ciphers are not likely to succeed until a valid and accepted definition of discrete chaos in finite domains is established, the inefficiencies of chaos-based cipher implementations are improved, and thorough security analysis reveals them to be comparable to standardized cryptographic primitives."

    abstract: "Keylogger programs attempt to retrieve confi- dential information by covertly capturing user input via keystroke monitoring and then relaying this information to others, often for malicious purposes. Keyloggers thus pose a major threat to business and personal activities such as Internet transactions, online banking, email, or chat. To deal with such threats, not only must users be made aware about this type of malware, but software practitioners and students must also be educated in the design, implementation, and monitoring of effective defenses against different keylogger attacks. This paper presents a case for incorporating keylog- ging in cybersecurity education. First, the paper provides an overview of keylogger programs, discusses keylogger design, implementation, and usage, and presents effective approaches to detect and prevent keylogging attacks. Second, the paper outlines several keylogging projects that can be incorporated into an undergraduate computing program to educate the next generation of cybersecurity practitioners in this important topic."
