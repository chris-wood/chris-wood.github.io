    abstract: "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is an emerging networking paradigm where named and routable data (content) is the focal point. Users send explicit requests (interests) which specify content by name, and the network handles routing these interests to some entity capable of satisfying them with the appropriate data response (producer). One key feature of ICN is opportunistic in-network content caching. This property facilitates efficient content distribution by reducing bandwidth consumption, lessening network congestion, and improving the content retrieval latency by users (consumers). Unfortunately, the same feature is also detrimental to privacy of content consumers and producers. Simple to implement, and difficult to detect, timing attacks can exploit ICN routers as “oracles” and allow an adversary to learn whether a nearby consumer recently requested certain content. The attack leverages a timing side channel that relies on router caches and is implemented by requesting a few packets from each piece of content being probed. Similarly, probing attacks that target content producers can be used to discover whether certain content has been recently distributed. After analyzing the scope and feasibility of such attacks, we propose and evaluate some efficient countermeasures that offer quantifiable privacy guarantees while retaining the benefits of ICN."

    abstract: "In recent years, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has received much attention from both academic and industry participants. ICN offers data-centric inter-networking that is radically different from today’s host-based IP networks. Security and privacy features on today’s Internet were originally not present and have been incre- mentally retrofitted over the last 35 years. As such, these issues have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures towards real-world deployment. Thus, while ICN-based architectures (e.g., NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques.
This report documents the highlights and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251 on “Information-centric Networking and Security.” The goal of which was to bring together researchers to discuss and address security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based archi- tectures. Upon finishing the three-day workshop, the outlook of ICN is still unclear. Many unsolved and ill-addressed problems remain, such as namespace and identity management, object se- curity and forward secrecy, and privacy. Regardless of the fate of ICN, one thing is certain: much more research and practical ex- perience with these systems is needed to make progress towards solving these arduous problems."

    abstract: "An L(2, 1) labeling of a graph G is a vertex labeling such that any pair of vertices v_i and v_j must have labels at least 2 apart if d(v_i,v_j) = 1 and labels at least 1 apart if d(v_i,v_j) = 2. The span of an L(2,1) labeling f on a graph G is the maximum f(u) for all u ∈ V (G). The L(2, 1) span of a graph G is the minimum span of all L(2, 1) labelings on G. The L(2, 1) labeling on trees has been extensively studied in recent years. In this paper we present a complete characterization of the L(2, 1) span of trees up to twenty vertices."
