        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a candidate next-generation Internet architecture
that offers an alternative to the current IP-based model. CCN emphasizes scalable and
efficient content distribution by making content explicitly named and addressable.
It also offers some appealing privacy features, such as lack of source and
destination addresses in packets. However, to be considered a fully viable Internet
architecture, CCN must support private and anonymous communication that is
at least at parity with IP. Within this space, VPNs are a very
popular tool that enable users to communicate across insecure public
networks as if they were connected over a private network.
They are also absent from the repertoire of CCN research.
To fill this void, we design, implement, and evaluate CCVPN, a content-centric
analog to IP-based VPNs in the current Internet architecture.
To the best of our knowledge, CCVPN is the first such CCN-based design.
Our design is functionally equivalent to IP-based VPNs while gaining
better privacy due to the non-linkability of encapsulated packets to their originating
network. We analyze the security of CCVPN and experimentally assess its performance."

        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a recently proposed Internet paradigm that focuses
on scalable, secure and efficient content distribution. The main abstraction is named
and addressable content. A consumer requests desired named content by generating
a so-called {\em interest}, which is then routed by the network towards
an in-network cached copy, or the authoritative producer, of that content.
Since all CCN content must be signed by its producer, consumers and routers
can cryptographically verify its correctness, authenticity, and integrity.
Thus, in principle, attacks that introduce fake (poisoned) content can be detected.
However, verifying content signatures is optional for CCN routers,
detection of fake content only implies presence of a malicious upstream entity.
A major outstanding problem in CCN is how to react to such attacks, determine their source(s),
and re-route interests accordingly.

In this work, we construct a technique based on efficient per-hop packet integrity checks.
Routers share secrets with neighboring routers and use them to verify and generate
efficient per-hop packet authenticators.
An on-path attacker that tampers with content in transit is quickly detected by downstream
routers. Moreover, an on-path attacker that hijacks a namespace is discoverable.
Our experimental assessment indicates that the proposed technique incurs very
low per-packet overhead. Furthermore, since our approach is not CCN-specific,
it can be applied to IP-based networks as well."

        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a network architecture for transferring
named content from producers to consumers upon request. The name-to-content
binding is cryptographically enforced with a digital signature generated by
the producer. Thus, content integrity and origin authenticity are core features of CCN.
In contrast, content confidentiality and privacy are left to the applications.
The typically advocated approach for protecting sensitive content is to use encryption,
i.e., restrict access to those who have appropriate decryption key(s). Moreover, content is typically
encrypted once for identical requests, meaning that many consumers obtain the same
encrypted content. From a privacy perspective, this is a step backwards from the
``secure channel'' approach in today's IP-based Internet, e.g., TLS or IPSec.

In this paper, we assess the privacy pitfalls of this approach, particularly, when the
adversary learns some auxiliary information about popularity of certain plaintext content.
Merely by observing (or learning) the frequency of requested content, the adversary can
learn which encrypted corresponds to which plaintext data. We evaluate this attack using a
custom CCN simulator and show that even moderately accurate popularity information suffices
for accurate mapping. We also show how the adversary can exploit caches to learn content popularity
information. The adversary needs to know the content namespace in order to succeed.
Our results show that encryption-based access control is insufficient for privacy in CCN.
More extensive counter-measures (such as namespace restrictions and content replication)
are needed to mitigate the attack."

        abstract: "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a recent paradigm that claims
to mitigate some limitations of the current IP-based Internet
architecture. The centerpiece of ICN is named and addressable content,
rather than hosts or interfaces. Content-Centric Networking (CCN)
is a prominent ICN instance that shares the fundamental architectural
design with its equally popular academic sibling Named-Data
Networking (NDN). CCN eschews source addresses and creates
one-time virtual circuits for every content request (called an
interest). As an interest is forwarded it creates state in
intervening routers and the requested content is delivered back
over the reverse path using that state.

Although a stateful forwarding plane might be beneficial in terms
of efficiency and resilience to certain types of attacks,
this has not been decisively proven via realistic experiments.
Since keeping per-interest state complicates router operations
and makes the infrastructure susceptible to router state
exhaustion attacks (e.g., there is currently no effective defense
against Interest Flooding attacks), the value of the
stateful forwarding plane in CCN should be re-examined.

In this paper, we explore supposed benefits and various problems
of the stateful forwarding plane. We then argue that its benefits are
uncertain at best, and it need not be a mandatory CCN feature.
To this end, we propose a new stateless architecture for CCN
that provides nearly all functionality of the stateful design
without its headaches. We analyze performance and resource
requirements of the proposed architecture via experiments."

        abstract: "In the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) architecture, content confidentiality is treated
    as an application-layer concern. Data is only encrypted if the producer and consumer
    agree on a suitable access control policy and enforcement mechanism. In contrast,
    transport encryption in TCP/IP applications is increasingly opportunistic for
    better privacy. This type of encryption is woefully lacking in CCN.
    To that end, we present TRAPS, a protocol to enable transparent packet security
    and opportunistic encryption for all CCN data. TRAPS builds on the assumption that
    knowledge of a name gives one access to the corresponding content; otherwise, by design, the
    content remains encrypted and secure. TRAPS builds on recent advances in memory
    hard functions and message-locked encryption to protect data in transit.
    We show that the security of TRAPS is dependent on the distribution of content
    names and argue that it can be significantly improved if secure sessions are
    used to transmit small pieces of information from producers to consumers. Our
    performance assessment indicates TRAPS is capable of providing opportunistic
    encryption to CCN without significant throughput loss for reasonable packet
    throughput measurements."

        abstract: "Content-centric networking (CCN) is a network architecture for transferring named data from producers to
consumers upon request. This shifts security from that of a connection or channel
to the content itself. There remains, however, many critical uses for the traditional client-server
communication model with secure sessions. For instance,
in many CCN applications, producers need a way to transfer key material or secret
information to consumers. Not only does caching this content fail to
serve multiple consumers, encrypting it under long-term, static keys
does not afford them any forward secrecy. Consequently, there is a real and
present need for a CCN-friendly protocol whose security properties
meet or exceed similar transport security protocols in IP networks. In this paper, we present the design
and implementation of the CCNx Key Exchange Protocol -- CCNxKE -- the first
protocol design for bootstrapping encrypted service-centric sessions in CCN.
We compare our design to that of
existing IP-based transport security protocols to highlight important
differences, discuss several important use cases for CCNxKE and secure sessions
in CCN, and present a preliminary performance assessment. Our experiments indicate that
session encryption adds, on average, a 30% data transfer latency compared to unencrypted
traffic using our prototype implementation."

        abstract: "We present SCR, a secure content replication protocol for the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) architecture.
The goal of SCR is to allow a data producer to cache protected content in off-path
semi-trusted caches or replicas. In contrast to the standard ``take what you want'' model of CCN,
SCR ensures that no unauthorized, off-path entity can obtain data from these replicas,
even if the content is encrypted. SCR allows a producer to encrypt data under any viable
access control scheme, such as group-based access backed by broadcast encryption, and delegate
the delivery of said content to distributed replicas in the network. SCR is analogous to
``blind caching'' in IP-based networks, which aim to provide caching
as a service in the presence of end-to-end encryption via TLS. We discuss the design details
and security features, e.g., revocation, of SCR. We then compare SCR to
the HTTP(S)-based blind caching model. We show that our scheme can outperform
blind caching due to (1) less protocol complexity and message overhead, (2) faster session
establishment, and (3) the ability to obtain data in parallel from multiple, independent replicas."

        abstract: "Content-centric networking is an architecture designed to transfer
named and addressable data from producers to consumers. Data retrieval is driven
by a simple request and response protocol. A consumer issues a request for
named data that is routed by the network towards the nearest location where
this data is stored. Once found, the corresponding data is returned to the
consumer. This data-centric model is different from the datagram- and
stream-based protocols used to transport data between endpoints in IP
networks: Instead of being tied to the channel through which data flows,
security and privacy properties apply to data itself.
Consequently, privacy issues in CCN warrant
careful evaluation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive assessment of CCN
privacy issues in the presence of various adversaries.
We specify conditions sufficient to achieve different levels of privacy.
We also show that data privacy is more dependent on requests than
responses for data. We conclude that strong privacy necessitates
some form of session- or channel-based communication, which strongly contradicts
the data-centric nature of CCN. We also discuss how to implement proposed CCN
privacy mechanisms in practice."

        abstract: "Content-centric networking (CCN) is a networking paradigm that
emphasizes request-response-based data transfer. A {\em consumer}
issues a request explicitly referencing desired data by name. A {\em producer}
assigns a name to each data it publishes. Names are used both to identify data
to and route traffic between consumers and producers. The type, format, and representation
of names are fundamental to CCN. Currently, names are represented as human-readable
application-layer URIs. This has several important security and performance implications
for the network.

In this paper, we propose to transparently decouple application-layer names from
their network-layer counterparts. We demonstrate a mapping between the two
namespaces that can be deterministically computed by consumers and producers,
using application names formatted according to the standard CCN URI scheme. Meanwhile,
consumers and producers can continue to use application-layer names. We detail the
computation and mapping function requirements and discuss their
impact on consumers, producers, and routers. Finally, we
comprehensively analyze several mapping functions to show their
functional equivalence to standard application names and argue that
they address several issues that stem from propagating application names into
the network."

One major drawback of in-network caching is that content producers have no
knowledge about where their content is stored. This is problematic if a
producer wishes to delete its content. In this paper, we show how to address
this problem with a protocol called BEAD (Best-Effort Autonomous Deletion).
It performs content deletion via small and secure packets that resemble

We discuss several methods of routing BEAD packets from producers to caching

Tor and new protocols such as tcpcrypt and DNS-over-TLS. Content-Centric Networking (CCN)

        abstract: "Block ciphers are essential cryptographic primitives used for encryption in resource constrained hardware systems. Many modern block ciphers are based on the substitution permutation network (SPN) design. The substitution step is commonly the only non-linear transformation in the cipher, and is usually comprised of a permutation which applies an S-box substitution to each element of the cipher state. In hardware, the S-box implementation has a significant impact on the area consumed by the cipher. Consequently, there have been considerable research and engineering efforts to obtain compact circuit implementations of S-boxes for hardware systems. Building on past work, we present a comprehensive methodology for (1) constructing cryptographically strong affine-power S-boxes over Galois fields and (2) minimizing the VLSI technology-independent combinational logic requirements for their circuit implementations. Motivated by the potential need for larger S-boxes with improved cryptographic properties, we use this methodology to construct area minimized circuits for novel 16-bit S-boxes."

        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an emerging network architecture
designed to overcome limitations of the current IP-based Internet.
One of the fundamental tenets of CCN is that content is
named and addressable. Consumers request content
by issuing interests with the desired content name. These interests
are forwarded by routers to producers, and the requested content is returned
and optionally cached at each router along the path.

In-network caching makes it difficult to enforce access control policies on sensitive content
since routers only use interest information for forwarding decisions. This motives our work
on Interest-Based Access Control (IBAC) -- a scheme for access control enforcement
using only information contained in interest messages. IBAC makes sensitive content names unpredictable
to unauthorized parties. It supports both hash- and encryption-based
name obfuscation. Interest replay
attacks are addressed by formulating a mutual trust framework between producers and consumers
that enables routers to perform authorization checks before satisfying interests
from local caches. We assess computational, storage, and bandwidth costs
of each IBAC variant. Proposed design is flexible
and allows producers to arbitrarily specify and enforce any type of content access control,
without having to deal with content encryption and
key distribution. This is the first comprehensive CCN access control design
that only uses information contained in interest messages."

        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a communication paradigm that emphasizes content distribution. Named-Data Networking (NDN) is an instantiation of CCN, a candidate Future Internet Architecture. NDN supports human-readable content naming and router-based content caching which lends itself to efficient, secure, and scalable content distribution. Because of NDN's fundamental requirement that each content object must be signed by its producer, fragmentation has been considered incompatible with NDN since it precludes authentication of individual content fragments by routers. The alternative is to perform hop-by-hop reassembly, which incurs prohibitive delays. In this paper, we show that secure and efficient content fragmentation is both possible and even advantageous in NDN and similar content-centric network architectures that involve signed content. We design a concrete technique that facilitates efficient and secure content fragmentation in NDN, discuss its security guarantees and assess performance. We also describe a prototype implementation and compare performance of cut-through with hop-by-hop fragmentation and reassembly."

This framework is both flexible and extensible, enabling the specification, implementation, and enforcement of a variety of access control policies for sensitive content in the network. The design of CCN-AC heavily relies on the concept of secure content object manifests and leverages them to decouple encrypted content from access policy and specifications for minimum communication overhead and maximum utilization of in-network caches. To demonstrate the flexibility of framework, we also describe how to implement two sample access control schemes, group-based access control and broadcast access control, within CCN-AC framework."

Once a design is implemented and meets timing constraints, the mission is to evaluate if it is achieving optimum performance. At this stage, the number of pipelines and functional units are fixed and the amount of resources and memory bandwidth are finalized. If a design is performing suboptimally the only recourse is to improve the control logic. In this paper we present a metric to quantify the achievable performance of a design and use it to analyze performance degradation due to control logic. We analyze the control logic of existing architectures and present improvements that achieve speedups of up to 10.7x."

        abstract: "Content-centric networking (CCN) project, a flavor of information-centric networking (ICN), decouples data from its source by shifting the emphasis from hosts and interfaces to information. As a result, content becomes directly accessible and routable within the network. In this data-centric paradigm, techniques for maintaining content confidentiality and privacy typically rely on cryptographic techniques similar to those used in modern digital rights management (DRM) applications, which often require multiple consumer-to-producer (end-to-end) messages to be transmitted to establish identities, acquire licenses, and access encrypted content. In this paper, we present a secure content distribution architecture for CCN that is based on proxy re-encryption. Our design provides strong end-to-end content security and reduces the number of protocol messages required for user authentication and key retrieval. Unlike widely-deployed solutions, our solution is also capable of utilizing the opportunistic in-network caches in CCN. We also experimentally compare two proxy re-encryption schemes that can be used to implement the architecture, and describe the proof of concept application we developed over CCNx."

        abstract: "One of the pitfalls of FPGA design is the relatively long implementation time when compared to alternative architec- tures, such as CPU, GPU or DSP. This time can be greatly reduced however by using tools that can generate hardware systems in the form of a hardware description language (HDL) from high- level languages such as C, C++, or Python. Such implementations can be optimized by applying special directives that focus the high-level synthesis (HLS) effort on particular objectives, such as performance, area, throughput, or power consumption. In this paper we examine the benefits of this approach by comparing the performance and design times of HLS generated systems versus custom systems for matrix multiplication. We investigate matrix multiplication using a standard algorithm, Strassen algorithm, and a sparse algorithm to provide a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities and usability of the Xilinx Vivado HLS tool. In our experience, a hardware-oriented electrical engineering student can achieve up to 61% of the performance of custom designs with 1/3 the effort, thus enabling faster hardware acceleration of many compute-bound algorithms."

From the perspective of cryp- tography and information security, randomness generated from entirely deterministic systems is a very appealing property. As such, the application of chaos in modern cryptography has been a topic of much research and debate for over a decade.
This paper presents an overview of chaotic dynamics and their role in symmetric key chaos-based cryptosystems from both a theoretical and practical perspective. It is argued that chaos-based ciphers are not likely to succeed until a valid and accepted definition of discrete chaos in finite domains is established, the inefficiencies of chaos-based cipher implementations are improved, and thorough security analysis reveals them to be comparable to standardized cryptographic primitives."

To deal with such threats, not only must users be made aware about this type of malware, but software practitioners and students must also be educated in the design, implementation, and monitoring of effective defenses against different keylogger attacks. This paper presents a case for incorporating keylog- ging in cybersecurity education. First, the paper provides an overview of keylogger programs, discusses keylogger design, implementation, and usage, and presents effective approaches to detect and prevent keylogging attacks. Second, the paper outlines several keylogging projects that can be incorporated into an undergraduate computing program to educate the next generation of cybersecurity practitioners in this important topic."

        abstract: "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is an emerging networking paradigm where named and routable data (content) is the focal point. Users send explicit requests (interests) which specify content by name, and the network handles routing these interests to some entity capable of satisfying them with the appropriate data response (producer). One key feature of ICN is opportunistic in-network content caching. This property facilitates efficient content distribution by reducing bandwidth consumption, lessening network congestion, and improving the content retrieval latency by users (consumers). Unfortunately, the same feature is also detrimental to privacy of content consumers and producers. Simple to implement, and difficult to detect, timing attacks can exploit ICN routers as “oracles” and allow an adversary to learn whether a nearby consumer recently requested certain content. The attack leverages a timing side channel that relies on router caches and is implemented by requesting a few packets from each piece of content being probed. Similarly, probing attacks that target content producers can be used to discover whether certain content has been recently distributed. After analyzing the scope and feasibility of such attacks, we propose and evaluate some efficient countermeasures that offer quantifiable privacy guarantees while retaining the benefits of ICN."

        abstract: "In recent years, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has received much attention from both academic and industry participants. ICN offers data-centric inter-networking that is radically different from today’s host-based IP networks. Security and privacy features on today’s Internet were originally not present and have been incre- mentally retrofitted over the last 35 years. As such, these issues have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures towards real-world deployment. Thus, while ICN-based architectures (e.g., NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques.
This report documents the highlights and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251 on “Information-centric Networking and Security.” The goal of which was to bring together researchers to discuss and address security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based archi- tectures. Upon finishing the three-day workshop, the outlook of ICN is still unclear. Many unsolved and ill-addressed problems remain, such as namespace and identity management, object se- curity and forward secrecy, and privacy. Regardless of the fate of ICN, one thing is certain: much more research and practical ex- perience with these systems is needed to make progress towards solving these arduous problems."

        abstract: "In recent years, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has received much attention from both academic and industry participants. ICN offers a data-centric means of inter-networking that is radically different from today's host-based IP networks. Security and privacy issues in ICN have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures and nears real-world deployment. As is well known, in today's Internet, security and privacy features were originally not present and had to be incrementally and individually retrofitted (with varying success) over the last 35 years. In contrast, since ICN-based architectures (e.g., NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques. This report documents the program and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251 \"Information-centric Networking and Security.\" The goal was to bring together researchers to discuss and address security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based architectures. Attendees represented diverse areas of expertise, including: networking, security, privacy, software engineering, and formal methods. Through presentations and focused working groups, attendees identified and discussed issues relevant to security and privacy, and charted paths for their mitigation."

        abstract: "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a recent paradigm that claims to mitigate some limitations of the current IP-based Internet architecture. The centerpiece of ICN is named and addressable content, rather than hosts or interfaces. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a prominent ICN instance that shares the fundamental architectural design with its equally popular academic sibling Named-Data Networking (NDN). CCN eschews source addresses and creates one-time virtual circuits for every content request (called an interest). As an interest is forwarded it creates state in intervening routers and the requested content back is delivered over the reverse path using that state.
Although a stateful forwarding plane might be beneficial in terms of efficiency, and resilience to certain types of attacks, this has not been decisively proven via realistic experiments. Since keeping per-interest state complicates router operations and makes the infrastructure susceptible to router state exhaustion attacks (e.g., there is currently no effective defense against interest flooding attacks), the value of the stateful forwarding plane in CCN should be re-examined.
In this paper, we explore supposed benefits and various problems of the stateful forwarding plane. We then argue that its benefits are uncertain at best and it should not be a mandatory CCN feature. To this end, we propose a new stateless architecture for CCN that provides nearly all functionality of the stateful design without its headaches. We analyze performance and resource requirements of the proposed architecture, via experiments."

        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a new class of network architectures designed to address some key limitations of the current IP-based Internet. One of its main features is in-network content caching, which allows requests for content to be served by routers. Despite improved bandwidth utilization and lower latency for popular content retrieval, in-network content caching offers producers no means of collecting information about content that is requested and later served from network caches. Such information is often needed for accounting purposes. In this paper, we design some secure accounting schemes that vary in the degree of consumer, router, and producer involvement. Next, we identify and analyze performance and security tradeoffs, and show that specific per-consumer accounting is impossible in the presence of router caches and without application-specific support. We then recommend accounting strategies that entail a few simple requirements for CCN architectures. Finally, our experimental results show that forms of native and secure CCN accounting are both more viable and practical than application-specific approaches with little modification to the existing architecture and protocol."

        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an emerging network architecture designed to overcome limitations of the current IP-based Internet. One of the fundamental tenets of CCN is that data, or content, is a named and addressable entity in the network. Consumers request content by issuing interest messages with the desired content name. These interests are forwarded by routers to producers, and the resulting content object is returned and optionally cached at each router along the path. In-network caching makes it difficult to enforce access control policies on sensitive content outside of the producer since routers only use interest information for forwarding decisions. To that end, we propose an Interest-Based Access Control (IBAC) scheme that enables access control enforcement using only information contained in interest messages, i.e., by making sensitive content names unpredictable to unauthorized parties. Our IBAC scheme supports both hash- and encryption-based name obfuscation. We address the problem of interest replay attacks by formulating a mutual trust framework between producers and consumers that enables routers to perform authorization checks when satisfying interests from their cache. We assess the computational, storage, and bandwidth overhead of each IBAC variant. Our design is flexible and allows producers to arbitrarily specify and enforce any type of access control on content, without having to deal with the problems of content encryption and key distribution. This is the first comprehensive design for CCN access control using only information contained in interest messages."

        abstract: "Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an emerging networking paradigm in which named content, rather than named network interfaces or hosts, are treated as first-class entities representing the end-points of communication in a network. This abstraction decouples data from its source to enable multiple, simultaneous providers of data within the network, which fosters optimized bandwidth consumption, improved availability, reduced latency, and efficient utilization of multiple network interfaces concurrently. In CCN, this abstraction layer is provided by a lightweight API called the CCN Portal. The CCN Portal API enables communication and interaction via atomic request and content response messages, though applications may often require more robust abstractions. To this end, we introduce the CCN Assembly Framework (AF). The AF provides a Create Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) interface for reading and manipulating data ``in the network.'' We then show how to use the AF API with the UNIX file I/O API, thereby placing file I/O and network communication under a single, standard API. The ultimate goal is to merge remote and local data to make applications \emph{network agnostic}, which is extremely compelling in society's increasingly network-oriented ecosystem."

In this work we present a methodology for minimizing the logic resources for n-bit affine-power S-boxes over Galois fields based on measurable security properties and finding corresponding area-efficient combinational implementations in hardware. Motivated by the potential need for new and larger S-boxes, we use our methodology to find area-optimized circuits for 8- and 16-bit S-boxes. Our methodology is capable of finding good upper bounds on the number of XOR and AND gate equivalents needed for these circuits, which can be further optimized using modern CAD tools."

        abstract: "Privacy problems that stem from a lack of truly anonymous communication in today’s Internet are exacerbated by growing evidence of large-scale network packet interception and eavesdropping [12]. Internet users have a limited set of tools available at their disposal to enable better communication, including Tor [3] and new protocols such as tcpcrypt [8, 9] and DNS-over-TLS [32]. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an emerging (inter-)networking architecture with the goal of becoming an alternative to the IP-based Internet. Such an architecture must at least have parity with IP based solutions for anonymous communication. Thus, there is a clear demand for a CCN analog to Tor and related protocols. ANDaNA (Anonymous Named Data Networking Applica- tion) was the initial attempt to satisfy this demand for CCNs in the context of the legacy Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture – an instance of CCN. However, its elementary design and hasty implementation led to performance and usability issues that hinder practical use. In this paper, we introduce AC3N: Anonymous Communication for Content- Centric Networking, a substantially evolved and improved incarnationofANDa ̄NA.AC3Nsupportshigh-throughput and low-latency anonymous content retrieval in modern CCNs, for both unidirectional and bidirectional settings. We discuss the design, implementation, performance, and anonymity prop- erties of AC3N. Our experimental results indicate that AC3N incurs very low overhead while providing anonymity features analogous to Tor."

Named-Data Networking (NDN) is an instantiation of CCN, a candidate Future Internet Architecture. NDN supports human-readable content naming and router-based content caching which lends itself to efficient, secure, and scalable content distribution. Because of NDN's fundamental requirement that each content object must be signed by its producer, fragmentation has been considered incompatible with NDN since it precludes authentication of individual content fragments by routers. The alternative is to perform hop-by-hop reassembly, which incurs prohibitive delays. In this paper, we show that secure and efficient content fragmentation is both possible and even advantageous in NDN and similar content-centric network architectures that involve signed content. We design a concrete technique that facilitates efficient and secure content fragmentation in NDN, discuss its security guarantees and assess performance. We also describe a prototype implementation and compare performance of cut-through with hop-by-hop fragmentation and reassembly."

In contrast with the host- based nature of addressable interfaces, ICNs make data directly addressable and routable within the network. This difference leads to different mechanisms to publish and retrieve data and enable peer-to-peer communication. Interoperability between the IP-based, point-to-point networks and CCNs are an important step toward deploying the benefits of ICNs without disrupting existing IP networks. We present CCNSink, an application layer middleware gateway providing interoperability between CCNs and IP. CCNSink provides semantic translation between the communication mechanisms used in both networks. We discuss the implementation details at length and study the performance overhead induced by this gateway and the message round-trip-time is studied in various communication settings."
