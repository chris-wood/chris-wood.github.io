title: Forward Secrecy -- Yay or Nay?
---

In a room full of security people, no one seemed to think that forward secrecy
was an important property for ICNs. I would be lying if I said that wasn't at 
least a little bit depressing. I will continue to press hard on the issue in
hopes that someone else realizes its importance. But, until then, object
security will continue to prevail.
