title: Clean research code
---

As a student and part-time software engineer, I write a lot of code. Some of it lives ephemeraly until the "experiment" phase of a project is complete, and some of it has much more longevity. Does this mean that research code -- the short-lived product of a single project or paper -- deserves less tender loving care? Based on the overwhelming majority of unpopular open source projects that are born in academia, the answer appears to be, inarguably, yes. 

- explain why code needs to be done quickly (deadlines, pressures from advisors, etc)
- hastiness often leads to shortcuts, bad practices, and just dirty, smelly code
- shipping the code is the main feature (shipping is the getting the data needed for hte experiment or proof-of-concept)
- small teams of students who often lack software engineering training

- long-term problems: no re-use, if experiments need to be revisited down the road it's difficult to understand what we were thinking (and we are the ones that wrote it!) -- include sample code here from circuit minimization library (christoff paar's matrix optimization code), cannot be used to help others (research is a collaborative effort)
- show how it can be refactored to help others! make the code clean (choose the SLP parser in Matrix_Validte.java)
