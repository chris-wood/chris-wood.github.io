title: What does security and privacy parity mean for CCN?
---

Anyone following the development of current IP transport protocols and 
associated application-layer protocols (i.e., HTTPS) should be aware
of the current security and privacy trends. After the Snowden fallout
and an increasing amount of distrust in federal agencies to respect the
privacy of the world's inhabitants, the need and demand for secure and 
private communication has never been higher. This, coupled with the 
emergence of efforts to create security solutions not backed by "trusted" 
third parties, such as Let's Encrypt, has created a political, cultural,
and industrial atmosphere of privacy paranoia with a tremendous amount
of momentum. In general, the movement seems to be: encrypt everything with
perfect forward secrecy.
