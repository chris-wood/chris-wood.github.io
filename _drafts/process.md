title: Some Process Pays
---

research lab: time split between code, prototyping, specification writing, research, design, patents, presentations, etc.

different people have different ideas about how to explore unchartered waters
people develop divergent opinions and ideas when working in isolation, and it's difficult to change their mind
when it comes time to write a spec, we need consensus on a design
I naively thought we had consensus on design, but that was wrong, we kept going in circles, people were contradicting 
themselves, and then when pressed would take themselves out of the argument 
I grew aggravated, and then after discussion with one boss, learned that stepping back to the requirements was needed (the conversation seemed to imply that we didn't have consensus there)
