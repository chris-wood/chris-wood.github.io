title: Moving from PARC to Apple
---

I'm happy to write (to the zero people who read this) that I'm leaving PARC and will be
joining Apple as a Secure Transport Engineer on the CoreOS team. I'm tremendously excited
for the opportunity to work some brilliant people on a team with a noticable impact
on real-world security. I'm also extremely grateful for everything PARC has done for me 
in the past. I've been fortunate enough to conduct research and development simultaneously
while finishing my PhD, I've travelled around the world to conferences and IETF gatherings,
and I've met and befriended many people with whom I would have not previously known
or contacted. I've also learned a great deal about the research and software development
lifecycle from Glenn Scott, my manager at PARC. I'm eternally grateful for his mentorship
as an engineer. I am proud of what I've accomplished while at PARC and I hope to carry these
lessons with me into Apple. I'm also owe many thanks to Ersin Uzun, who is primarily
responsible for bringing me to PARC in the first place. He has spent many hours as my mentor
and research big brother -- showing me the ropes and training me for a career in research. 
And these are just two of the many people with whom I've been fortunate enough to call
my colleagues. Transitioning to Apple will be a noticable change, but I think that with
everything PARC has given me and taught me, it's something I'm well prepared to tackle.
