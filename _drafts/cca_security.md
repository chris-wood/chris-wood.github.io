title: Clarifying Encryption Security
---

# What is Secure Encryption?
- what does it mean for an encryption scheme to be secure?
- the ciphertext should reveal nothing about the plaintext -> notion of indistinguishability
- TODO: describe the general security game

# Indistinguishable Extensions
- describe all variations: IND, CPA, CCA -- and give examples of each one and how the games are different
- describe adaptive vs non-adaptive
- show the table that has adaptive/non-adaptive vs example

# Equivalences
- show equivalences
