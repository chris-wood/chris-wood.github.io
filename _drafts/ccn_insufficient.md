title: Deficiencies in CCN
---

CCN is the equivalent of HTTP GET, but what about the other methods? HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE
Are we so naive that we think we can completely replace mutable resources with immutable content (POSTs are for mutations..., GETS with actions are side effects). 
Mutabiliy is often needed
CCN should make mutability explicit and try to incorporate a POST-like command -- maybe these could also carry an address (pseudonym as in Bitcoin)
what are the semantics
