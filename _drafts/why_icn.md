title: Why Bother with ICN?
---

- Why should industry consider finding funding dollars for ICN?
    - ability to re-think the network stack (IP with NATs emerged as an end-to-end protocol when applications and protocols were built on endpoints, not connectivity)
    - remember: networks are only needed because we want to transfer data from one machine to another. if we didn't need to get data from somewhere else or interact with a service, we would not need a network
    - 

- What do you consider the gaps/opens in ICN research?
    - security and privacy
    - broadcast encryption 
    - distributed trust models (a la Bitcoin and PGP)
