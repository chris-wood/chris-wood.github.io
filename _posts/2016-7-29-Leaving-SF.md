title: Leaving SF
---

This is a sad week. I'm leaving San Francisco to move back to San Mateo. That's not all bad, though.
San Mateo is a great town. My new place is close to downtown, which is chock full of great restaurants.
It's also conveniently close to the Caltrain stop. This takes a lot of the hassle out of my daily commute
to Palo Alto. (The two-hour ride to and from SF was rough.) 

So I don't have much to write about this week. I've been too busy packing and getting ready for the move.
That's all for now.
